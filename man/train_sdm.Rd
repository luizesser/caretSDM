\usage{
train_sdm(
  occ,
  pred = NULL,
  algo,
  ctrl = NULL,
  variables_selected = NULL,
  parallel = FALSE,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{occ}{A occurrences object or a input_sdm.}

\item{pred}{A predictors object. If a input_sdm object is used, then pred is obtained from it.}

\item{algo}{Algorithms to be used. For a complete list see (https://topepo.github.io/caret/available-models.html). 'maxent', 'mahal.dist' and 'bioclim' are also implemented, but they are only available to run alone, with no other algorithm together.}

\item{ctrl}{A trainControl object to be used to build models. See ?trainControl.}

\item{variables_selected}{A vector of variables to be used as predictors. If NULL, predictors_names from pred will be used. Can also be a selection method (e.g. 'vif').}
}
\value{
A models object
}

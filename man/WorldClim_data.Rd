\usage{
WorldClim_data(path = NULL,
               period = "current",
               variable = "bioc",
               year = "2090",
               gcm = "mi",
               ssp = "585",
               resolution = 10)
}
\arguments{
\item{path}{Directory path to save downloads.}

\item{period}{Can be "current" or "future".}

\item{variable}{Allows to specify which variables you want to retrieve Possible entries are:
"tmax","tmin","prec" and/or "bioc".}

\item{year}{Specify the year you want to retrieve data. Possible entries are:
"2030", "2050", "2070" and/or "2090". You can use a vector to provide more than one entry.}

\item{gcm}{GCMs to be considered in future scenarios. You can use a vector to provide more than
one entry.}

\item{ssp}{SSPs for future data. Possible entries are: "126", "245", "370" and/or "585".
You can use a vector to provide more than one entry.}

\item{resolution}{You can select one resolution from the following alternatives: 10, 5, 2.5 OR 30.}
}
\value{
If data is not downloaded, the function downloads the data and has no return value.
}
\description{
This function allows to download data from WorldClim v.2.1
(https://www.worldclim.org/data/index.html) considering multiple GCMs, time periods and SSPs.
}
\details{
This function will create a folder. All the data downloaded will be stored in this
folder. Note that, despite being possible to retrieve a lot of data at once, it is not
recommended to do so, since the data is very heavy.

\examples{
\donttest{
# download data from multiple periods:
year <- c("2050", "2090")
WorldClim_data(period = "future",
               variable = "bioc",
               year = year,
               gcm = "mi",
               ssp = "126",
               resolution = 10)

# download data from one specific period
WorldClim_data(period = "future",
               variable = "bioc",
               year = "2070",
               gcm = "mi",
               ssp = "585",
               resolution = 10)

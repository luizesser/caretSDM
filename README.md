`caretSDM` is a under development R package that uses the powerful `caret` package as the main engine to obtain Species Distribution Models. As `caret` is a packaged turned to build machine learning models, `caretSDM` has a strong focus on this approach.

## Installation

You can install the development version of caretSDM from [GitHub](https://github.com/luizesser/caretSDM) with:

``` r
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("luizesser/caretSDM")
```

The package is also available on CRAN. Users are able to install it using the following code:

``` r
install.packages("caretSDM")
```

## You need help?

caretSDM is vastly documented and has included some objects that can guide your data management. If some of your data or code seem to be wrong, try to take a look at those objects or the articles in the website:

*Objects*

-   `bioc` Bioclimatic variables for current scenario in stars class.

-   `rivs` Hydrological variables for current scenario in sf class.

-   `occ` *Araucaria angustifolia* occurrence data as a dataframe.

-   `salm` *Salminus brasiliensis* occurrence data as a dataframe.

-   `parana` Shapefile to use in `sdm_area` in Simple Feature class.

-   `scen` Bioclimatic variables for future scenarios in stars class.

-   `scen_rs` Bioclimatic variables for invasive assessments vignette.

-   `algorithms` Dataframe with characteristics from every algorithm available in caretSDM.

*Articles*

-   `Adding New Algorithms to caretSDM` do not found your ideal algorithm already implemented? Here we show how to implement any custom algorithm in our package.

-   `caretSDM Workflow for Species Distribution Modeling` is the main vignette for terrestrial species modeling, where we model the tree species *Araucaria angustifolia*.

-   `Concatenate functions in caretSDM` shows how to build compact scripts, which is very useful to run your first tests.

-   `Projecting Non-native Distribution using SDMs` a vignette demonstrating how to make invasiveness assessments.

-   `Modeling Species Distributions in Continental Water Bodies` is the main vignette for continental aquatic species modeling, where we model the fish species *Salminus brasiliensis*.

-   `Modeling Rare Species using Ensemble of Small Models` we showcase how easy it is to apply SDMs to rare species with low number of records.

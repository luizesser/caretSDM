#' Hydrologic Variables

#' A \code{sf} LINESTRING object with hydrologic variables (LENGTH_KM and DIST_DN_KM) for the ParanÃ¡
#' state in Brazil. Data obtained from HydroSHEDS for river flows >= 10m3/s.

#' @format ## `rivs`
#' A \code{sf} with 1031 attributes and 2 fiels:
#' \describe{
#'   \item{LENGTH_KM}{Length of the river reach segment, in kilometers.}
#'   \item{DIST_DN_KM}{Distance from the reach outlet, i.e., the most downstream pixel of the reach,
#'   to the final downstream location along the river network, in kilometers. This downstream
#'   location is either the pour point into the ocean or an endorheic sink.}

# caretSDM 1.1.0

-   Initial CRAN submission.

# caretSDM 1.1.1

-   Inclusion of Non-native Distribution using caretSDM with adaptations on sdm_area function to allow the use of scenarios that do not particularly match the modeling area.

# caretSDM 1.1.2

-   Inclusion of methods to include new algorithms in caretSDM.

# caretSDM 1.1.3

-   Inclusion of Ensemble of Small Models in caretSDM.

# caretSDM 1.1.4

-   Inclusion of functions to add different classes together, as well as plots for niche and background. First attempts to include independent test data. tSNE is also working properly now. Inclusion of testing to improve code coverage.

# caretSDM 1.1.5

-   Plotting ensemble predictions is working. Added blockCV methods for crossvalidation.

# caretSDM 1.2

-   Inclusion of MaxEnt and Mahalanobis Distance directly on caretSDM. 
-   Pseudoabsences can now be retrieved outside a buffer. 
-   Inclusion of functions: correlate_sdm, prediction_change_sdm and tuneGrid_sdm.

# caretSDM 1.2.1

-   A error on plots assertion was corrected to better describe assertion problems.

# caretSDM 1.2.2

-   A CRS correction for add_scenarios function was missing for the crop_area parameter.

# caretSDM 1.2.3

-   There was a problem with add_scenarios function when adding a stars with a crop_by.
